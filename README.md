made syntax highlighter cus why not lol https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/avalehi


i hope to update this in the near future to actually make this COMPILE
for now it just translates to c & asm but
you have to manually link it / compile it
will be fixed but for now i dont know
also codegenasm.c is really funky
both codegens are unoptimized will fix that soonTM

CODEGENASM.C IS REALLY FUNKY I RECOMMEND USING CODEGEN.C THAT CONVERTS .TL TO .C CODE WORKS FINE (will be fixing codegenasm soon)
